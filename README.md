## Wine Quality Analysis with Python, AWS and Tableau

Wine quality is an important factor for both producers and consumers. The goal of this analysis is to explore which factors have the most impact on wine quality for a given dataset. The dataset includes a variety of features that may influence wine quality, such as pH, alcohol content, and the presence of certain chemicals. By analyzing the data, we aim to identify the key factors that contribute to high wine quality, as well as any potential correlations or trends. This analysis will be useful for wine producers who want to improve the quality of their wines, as well as for consumers who want to make informed purchasing decisions.
